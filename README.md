# Module-5-Challenge


OVerview: This repository contains two datasets. The first one is mouse_metadata.csv. It contains the mouse id of each mosue that was sued for this study. It details the mouse id, gender, drug regimen, age, and weight. The second data set is the study_results of the mouse. It has Mouse ID, Timepoint,	Tumor Volume (mm3), and	Metastatic Sites. This was used for the study of tumors based on drug regimen.


For this challenge, I cleaned the data by merging them into one dataframe. I also had to summarize the data to find the mean, median and the std of tumor volume for each regimen. I also created bar charts and pie charts to visualize timepoints and distribution of data. ALong with box plots and line/scatter plots to better show data collected.
